# CIS450CodeRepository

Hello, my name is Nick Grinstead! This repository holds the code that I wrote for the individual projects I created for a game programming design patterns course. Each project was made in Unity and consisted of a game feature that utilized a specific design pattern. To learn more about these projects, please feel free to visit this portfolio website here: https://sites.google.com/mail.bradley.edu/nickgrinsteadpatternsportfolio/home.
